## Discripton
The about me project was a semester long project that showed us a lot of different skills needed to create a functional and good looking website. Throughout the semester I would continually add elements and style to the website as my web development skills increased and my comprehension of the material depend. There are multiple different sections to my website, at the top there is a navigation bar; one of the newest additions to the site. This is used to seamlessly traverse the site visiting the Bio, image gallery, blog, and lastly my contact form. The second section is a biography; a little about me, where I am from and what I like to do in my free time. Following that is a section with a video I made of myself, this was great practice with iframes and embedding in code, there are a lot of different ways that this could be used in the future. Next, there is an image gallery with some pictures that give the viewer a glimpse into my life outside of schools and web development. This section was a great learning experiment, it showed me how to add images to html and style them using css. This is one of the most responsive parts of my website. It completely changes the layout and the flow of the site when the screen sizes change. After the gallery, there is a blog post about one of the elements on the site that I found especially interesting. This was an interesting part of the project because it gave me the freedom to do really anything that I wanted to my site. The last element on the site is a contact form where someone can input their information and send me a message about anything they would like. This was a good exercise to get us used to the forms, elements, field sets, and legends. After the completion of the website I will have a grasp of the fundamentals of web development, I can now go above and beyond the basics by using my knowledge of css and html to create something truly unique.
## Color Scheme
