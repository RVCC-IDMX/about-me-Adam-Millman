## Discripton
The about me project was a semester long project that showed us a lot of differnet skills needed to create a functional and good looking website. Throughout the semester I would continually add elements and style to the website as my web development skills increased and my comprehention of the material deepend. There are multiple different sections to my website, at the top there is a navigation bar; one of the newest addition to the site. This is used to seamlessly traverse the site visiting the Bio, image gallery, blog, and lastly my contact form. The second section is a biography; a little about me, where I am from and what I like to do in my free time. Following that is a section with a video I made of myself, this was great practice with iframes and embedding in code, there are a lot of different ways that this could be used in the future.
